# Power Auras

This Mod was created to have a better visibility when you gain buffs, debuffs and many more. Very util for shorts buffs or debuffs, it allows you to have in the center of the screen, or around your character, very customizable visual effects, rather than all the time have to look on the other side of the screen to see if you have a buff or a debuff on you.

Initially created to have an better visibility on the short buffs like "clear cast" or some boost trinket you activate, it works now with debuffs (whatever their name), debuff types like Magic or Curse, combo points, Aoe debuffs and weapon enchants.


# How to use :

1. Type /powa, to open the effect browser
2. Clic on the button "New" to create a new effect
3. On the effect editor, you can choose the texture to apply to the effect, the position, the size, the symmetry, be creative :P
4. Below, select the activator of the effect (like a buff, debuff, etc...)
5. Enter the name of the buff, debuff... juste below (or a part of the buff, like "clear" for activation with the buff "clear cast"). Don't forget to read the tooltips for more help on ways to enter the names
6. It's ready ! Close all windows, when you gain the buff/debuff, the effect appear
